Cyber Security Scripts

Harden Windows Security - March 2025.
    
    This script applies a set of security settings to enhance system protection, including:
    - Attack Surface Reduction (ASR) rules to block known threats.
    - Brute force protection and aggressiveness tuning.
    - Control over various real-time scanning options, cloud protection, and email scanning.
    - Configuration of controlled folder access, automatic scan scheduling, and signature updates.
    
    It is recommended to implement these settings for stronger security posture, particularly in preventing malware, ransomware, and brute force attacks. This script is intended for systems requiring robust protection, ensuring that Microsoft Defender is optimized for defense against modern threats.

    IMPORTANT: Ensure that the system meets prerequisites for some of the advanced settings like ASR and Cloud protection.
